## Location

Keysa Park, Vandenberg Ave, Lancaster, NY 14086

## Description

This is a fairly large skatepark. While it lacks an actual manual pad, the park has a decent variety of obstacles. In addition to the standard elements, there are mellow banks for beginners, and a big euro gap for advanced skaters. There's some room for flat-ground skating in the corners of the park.

Phase II, including an A-frame and 3' quarter pipe, was completed in 2018.

The park is popular with children who do laps around the park.
