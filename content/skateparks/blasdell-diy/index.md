## Location

Telfer St, Blasdell, NY 14219

## Description

DIY in Blasdell with an ever-changing mix of obstacles.

### Summer 2024 update

The pool coping on the larger box and steep ramp is gone. The ramp thresholds have chipped away and could use some maintenance. Moms Skateshop donated their Go Skate Day obstacles to the DIY (as they did in 2023).

## Features

- boxes
- manual pad
- small spine
- kicker
- small, aggressive quarter pipe
