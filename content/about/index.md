This website is meant to be a comprehensive list of skateparks in and around Buffalo, New York. There are great skateparks in Jamestown and Rochester, but they were intentionally omitted from this list.

Our goal is to provide photos and a list of features for each skatepark. Map websites often have photos of a skatepark, but frequently they have many duplicate or irrelevant photos, too. Also, it can be difficult to tell from photos how big a quarter pipe is.

This is an open-source project. If you'd like to contribute to this project, see [github.com/cberes/buffaloskateparks](https://github.com/cberes/buffaloskateparks).
